        <section id="step1">
            <h2>Step 1: Harvesting and Selection</h2>
            <p>The first step is to harvest bamboo, which is typically ready for use in construction after about 3-5 years of growth. Selecting the right bamboo is crucial, focusing on maturity, size, and quality.</p>

        </section>
        <section id="step2">
            <h2>Step 2: Bamboo Processing</h2>
            <p>The harvested bamboo is then cut into uniform lengths. It is split and flattened into slats. These slats are treated to remove sugars and starches, which helps in preventing pest attacks and decay.</p>
            <!-- Detailed information about step 2 -->
        </section>
        <section id="step3">
            <h2>Step 3: Drying</h2>
            <p>The bamboo slats are then dried to reduce moisture content. This can be done either naturally under the sun or using kilns for faster and more controlled drying. Proper drying is essential to prevent warping or cracking in the final product.</p>

        </section>
        <section id="step4">
            <h2>Step 4: Gluing and Layering</h2>
            <p>The dried slats are coated with an adhesive, often a formaldehyde-based glue or a more environmentally friendly option. They are then layered in a cross-laminated structure, where each layer is oriented perpendicular to the next, enhancing
                the strength and stability of the board.</p>

        </section>
        <section id="step5">
            <h2>Step 5: Pressing</h2>
            <p>The layered bamboo slats are then pressed under high temperature and pressure. This process fuses the layers together, forming a solid matboard. The pressure and temperature must be carefully controlled to ensure proper bonding without damaging
                the bamboo</p>

        </section>
        <section id="step6">
            <h2>Step 6: Trimming and Sanding</h2>
            <p>After pressing, the bamboo matboard is trimmed to size and sanded. Sanding ensures a smooth surface and removes any irregularities or rough edges, making the board ready for finishing and use</p>
            <!-- Detailed information about step 6 -->
        </section>
        <section id="step7">
            <h2>Step 7: Finishing and Quality Control</h2>
            <p>The final step involves applying finishes, such as sealants or paints, as required by the end-use of the product. Quality control is conducted throughout the manufacturing process, but a final inspection ensures that the bamboo matboard meets
                the desired specifications and quality standards</p>
