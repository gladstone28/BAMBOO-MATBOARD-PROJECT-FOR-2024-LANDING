            <p>In the final stage, the Bamboo Matboard undergoes finishing treatments, such as applying sealants or paints, to enhance its durability and appearance. This stage also includes rigorous quality control checks to ensure the product meets all
                specified standards.</p>

                <strong>note on a relevant iso standard</strong> <span>ISO 6128:2023(E)</span> Introduction - Laminated bamboo <strong>(Plywood or matboard are also terms used)</strong> products are used for purposes such as construction, furniture, handicrafts
                and novelty items. These products, such as floor planks or boards, have a large market in the construction industry. Furniture for the “high end” and “do-it-yourself “markets has also found an application of laminated bamboo products.
                These products are one of the main materials for bamboo furniture. Accordingly, the market for laminated bamboo furniture is growing steadily. In 2018, the market size for bamboo furniture was valued at USD 10,09 billion and is expected
                to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5,2 % from 2019 to 2025. - In view of the above, such applications of laminated bamboo in the furniture industry warrant the development of a standard testing procedure and property requirements.
                This document aims to address the need for a standard for laminated products made of bamboo strips for indoor furniture purposes.
