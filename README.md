# Bamboo Matboard Manufacturing Web based Application:

### Overview

This project is a web-based platform dedicated to providing detailed insights into the manufacturing process of bamboo matboards. The website offers an in-depth look at each step of the manufacturing process, from harvesting and selection of bamboo to the final quality control checks.

Please see below for an example from the Bamboo Harvesting and Selection section. The full project gives similar description of all the 7 sections(not shown in the landing page)

#### Bamboo Harvesting and Selection

Selecting the right bamboo for manufacturing products like Bamboo Matboard involves several crucial considerations to ensure the quality and sustainability of the final product. Here's a guide to the selection process:

1. **Age and Maturity:** Typically, bamboo reaches its optimal strength and maturity for construction purposes between 3 to 5 years. Harvesting bamboo that is either too young or too old can affect the quality of the matboard. Young bamboo is weaker, while overly mature bamboo may start to lose its structural integrity.

2. **Species Selection:** There are over a thousand species of bamboo. Selecting the right species is vital as different species have varied properties in terms of strength, flexibility, color, and texture. The choice of species depends on the desired characteristics of the final product. QSL has studied this problem for Jamaica where our founder had several discussions with experts at INBAR and recommends that Bamboo be named in the Agricultural Produce Act. That will enable the Forestry Department, NEPA, the BSJ and others to unite in offering extension services and bamboo plantlets and guidance to the Bamboo Farmers in Jamaica. QSL recommends that guidance be provided for the re-growing of existing acreages of Bambusa vulgaris, as well as determination of  the volume of Dendrocalamus asper and Dendrocalamus Latiflourus presently growing in Jamaica. This step which can be further developed in a separate document is a pre-requesite to the mass manufacturing of bamboo matboard in Jamaica 

3. **Physical Inspection:** Visually inspect the bamboo for any signs of damage, infestation, or disease. Look for uniformity in color and avoid bamboo with cracks, splits, or any signs of rotting. The surface should be smooth, without any irregular growths or deformities.

4. **Size and Diameter:** Consistent size and diameter are important for uniformity in production. The diameter should match the requirements of the manufacturing process and the intended use of the matboard. Larger diameters are often preferred for their strength.

5. **Straightness:** Choose bamboo that is as straight as possible. Curved or bent bamboo can be challenging to process and might not provide the uniformity needed for quality matboard.

6. **Moisture Content:** Bamboo with high moisture content is more prone to warping and pest infestation. While it's difficult to assess moisture content in the field, generally, drier bamboo is preferred. Proper drying will follow during the manufacturing process.

7. **Eco-friendly and Sustainable Harvesting:** Ensure that the bamboo is sourced from a sustainable plantation that does not contribute to deforestation. Sustainable harvesting practices involve cutting the bamboo in a way that does not damage the root system, allowing for regrowth.

8. **Local Climate and Growing Conditions:** The quality of bamboo can also be influenced by the climate and soil conditions in which it grows. Bamboo grown in its native or ideal conditions is generally of higher quality.

By carefully considering these factors, manufacturers can select the right bamboo, which is a crucial step in ensuring the quality, durability, and sustainability of Bamboo Matboard. **Step 2 is crucially necessary for Jamaica and must be looked at by Policy Makers urgently.**

### Introduction

- Laminated bamboo (Plywood or matboard are also terms used) products are used for purposes such as construction, furniture, handicrafts and
novelty items. These products, such as floor planks or boards, have a large market in the construction
industry. Furniture for the “high end” and “do-it-yourself “markets has also found an application
of laminated bamboo products. These products are one of the main materials for bamboo furniture.
Accordingly, the market for laminated bamboo furniture is growing steadily. In 2018, the market size
for bamboo furniture was valued at USD 10,09 billion and is expected to grow at a compound annual
growth rate (CAGR) of 5,2 % from 2019 to 2025.
- In view of the above, such applications of laminated bamboo in the furniture industry warrant the
development of a standard testing procedure and property requirements. This document aims to
address the need for a standard for laminated products made of bamboo strips for indoor furniture
purposes.
